This is an epub creation library written in Go.

The idea is that you fill up some metadata objects, give some files for the book chapters, and the library will create a passable ePub file.

[feedepub](https://github.com/nikolawannabe/feedepub) is a sample client that takes an rss feed and turns it into a mostly-passable epub.
